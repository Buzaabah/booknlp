Freedom would be given to me in the evening to go on a fishing expedition . God made farmers kings on their farms . Most of the things that are valued by people living in the town are valueless to them . Firewood is of no impbrtance to them ; leaves are without honour ; foodstuffs are too much . A man ignorant of the power of God should go and observe the various unique things on the farm . There are tall trees as well as short ones ; there are big birds , as well as small ones . Snakes are running around while snails are quietly gliding about ; spiders are making webs while termites are creating motinds . Some birds live in trees ; some inhabit burrowed holes ; while others reside in nests . Bats swing their heads downward to sleep ; owls hoot - about in the night ; doves announce the different times of the day to the farmers as the natural clock of the forest . The farmers wash down their meals with cold water . Doubtlessly , you would know the proverb of the elders that “ How many are countable among the teeth of ‘

But what became of the person I saw on my way to the farm , the man that touched my head with a staff ? He was no more seen by me again till today but I came across him sometimes in my dreams and I would tell you how I do . ^ The first time I saw him , he appeared to me on the way to our farm .

After waking up and discovering I was dreaming , I became frightened . But I did not come across the man in my dreams again until the third year . In the third year after this , I slept again and saw him in a dream . He appeared just like before and placed me on his shoulder , flying . On getting to the part of the sky where he usually stopped , he did not . After flying for a while , he got to a place where there was a very big bright light . After focusing my eyes on the light , I discovered that it turned to a house . The man then entered the aerial house with me . On entering , I saw that the whole floor was made of gold . Fright deterred me from stepping on it , but the man that brought me inside told me to do so . After this , he took me inside one of the rooms iii the house . IREKE ONIBUDO

I was surprised that the world could be so near to where we were because we had flown really high . The man then told me to bd observing the river and take , note of nil what I would see . I fixed my eyes oh the ground . He closed the door of the room and went elsewhere . A little while later , I saw an old man that came to bathe in the river . He came with a bag of money . After bathing , he left , leaving the bag of money behind . Later , a chimpanzee came out of the forest and opened the bag and started pouring its content away . It then left some money inside the bag’after pouring some away . After his departure , a man came to bathe . When he got to the river , he saw the remaining money in the bag ; he took it and fled . After his departure , an old man came to bathe in the river . The owner of the money came with a gun as he was busy bathing . He saw the old man and asked him about the money , but he said he did not see any money when he got to the river . The owner of the money disbelieved him and shot him dead . After that , I saw nobody agaip . Soon , the person that took me to the room entered . He asked me what I saw in the river and I told him everything . He then said , “ Judge the cdse : who was guilty of all the people that came to the river ? ” I tried to judge but it proved difficult . He said , “ Young man , the work of God is mysterious .

Varieties of sweet - scenting flowers were thepe , but the paths in - between the linearly planted flowers were made of gold and all the flower pots were made of gold . All the materials seen by me Were golden . Just before me was a beautiful mansion incomparable to any of the palaces in the whole world . The man and I walked into the house through the golden way . On getting to the mansion , what I saw there were so precious to the extent that their cost was beyond evaluation . All the seats there were made from diamonds , and the floor and seat rugs were sewn with golden threads . I was'terrified on getting to the house , stepping on the floor reluctantly but the man that brought me to the mansion disregarded its beauty . He was walking on the golden floor'indifferently . He held me and told me to follow

The period when launderers are opportuned to have sun for drying their clothes . Rain does not act as an impediment to any important ceremony . No tree falls across roads and paths . No mud splashes on one ’s trousers . The dry season is different from the raining season in those aforementioned ways . My guest and I looked up and observed the presence of stars , in the sky .

If human beings only kill and eat fishes , we would not have been much aggrieved because they are divinely positioned to do so but the punishment that uncountable number.of them mete out to fishes before killing them is contrary to the commandmeht of God .

When I told herj she said it was not difficult to get a yam seedling that could mature in a day . The person that accompanied her said such a yam seedling was ir heaven but could be got in a far - away place there ; consequently , she had to fly .there . My mother quickly implored her to do so . She at once stamped her feet on the ground and it op6ned up ; she entered and flew into it . She later returned with yam seedlings ; they were small . Each one had the size of palm - kernel fiuit . “ After that , my mother called on the heavenly battalion and they emerged from the ground with their cutlasses and hoes . The work was done within a short moment . The yam seedlings grew immediately and swelled up ; the heaps in the farm also swelled up . My mother and the heavenly battalion returned to heaven at cockcrow . I woke up at sunrise and went to the Gargantuan- mermaid aftpr brushing my teeth and washing my face to tell her that I had finished the task given to me . After telling her , she went to confirm it . She shouted to the extent that all her chiefs heard : the land also shook “ because she had started thinkin g that I might defeat her instead of her eliminating me . The incident terrified her to the extent that she could not bathe for six hours on that day despite the fact that she used to bathe hourly under normal circumstances . ^ IREKE ONIBUDO0

I witnessed something onlhe night of the day the queen of the fishes told me of the fight . I laid on the floor of my room watching the witch - mother as she entered one of the big pots . On doing that , a python emerged from the pot ; it crawled around for sometime but did not get to where I was . Later , it entered the pot nearest to me and after coming out , it turned to be mother of the Gargantuan - mermaid . After that , she entered another pot . Having done that , a lion emerged from .the pot . Some moments later , the lion entered the pot near me and turned to the.mother of the Gargantuan - mermaid . That was how the woman experimented many things with the pots , metamorphosing to various things . She was changing to her natural being in the pot near me . I was watching all her actions because there was moonlight . \ “ On the night of the next day , I put the kola nut.^iven to me by Ilepa of the town of the dead in my mouth to prevent being seen by anyone .

But , I want you to come and see my mother in the evening . She is really eager to see you . Yours , Ifepade “ The reply was brief but it brought me some tiding . In the evening , I went to her mother as she requested . When I arrived there , I prostrated fully to greet her and she responded cheerfully . After greeting me , she instructed fhat a seat be brought for me ; it was done . The wpman and I entered a room . She then began to talk to me thus : ‘

So , I accompanied her to the palace and told her mother the outcome of our visitation before returning home . “ At dawn the next day ’s morning , the man went to the king ’s palace as promised . He sent for me at about 10 am and I responded . On getting to his house , he said the king had joyfully agreed to give his child to me for marriage . I visited thfe king thereafter to express my appreciation . The girl and I engaged each other in a roniance that is so difficult to come by between '
34543	34936	34536	34536	She	1651	’ t visit her . We ate with the same spoon ; if she took a spoonful of rice and beans from the plate and put it in . my mouth , I would eat part of it and put the remainder in her mouth . If she also ate part of a morsel , the rest would be put in my mouth ; If she was indisposed and there was.mucus in her nostrils , I would be responsible for its removal and vice versa . I washed her feet whenever she^wanted to go out and she washed mine also whenever I wanted to stroll out . We held each other by the hand in our strolls . We ate similar things ; we wore the same type of clothes ; and we used similar chewing sticks . If a stone hurt me , she would deliberately hurt herself with a stone . If she was also hurt by a stone , I would also consciously sustain injury by hitting my feet against the stone . We kissed seventy - two times daily amounting to an average of six times per hour . I recall some funny things we did when in love . “ One day , we went to the farm together and got to a stream . It was not deep but muddy and a small plank was placed on it for passage . Wheifwe got there , I carried Ifepade ; trying to cross over with her on the plank . As I stepped on the plank , iny feet slipped . Both of us fell inside the mud and carried , each other to the palace in that appearance , “ On another occasion , we climbed a hill to the peak . As we were descending at the opposite side , with her at the front , she slipped . I held her to prevent her from falling down but I also slipped . We both fell down and rolled Qontinuously down the hill falling on each other in quick succession : . " “ We loved each other dearly . If I climbed a tree , she would afso do so .

In my journey , I continued mentioning her name , calling her multifarious derogatory names and cursing her . “ She left the town she first arrived in . In her journey , she got to a forest pervaded by the lion ’s roaring at night . She met numerous famous people that wanted her hand in marriage- but she disagreed . She always told them to help search for her Ireke Onibudo . That was during my wanderings . I would spontaneously soliloquise about her name saying , ‘

After much thought , we decided not to follow them but they begged us to do so for their sake because the king had vowed to kill them should they fail to bring us back . I thought over it and convinced Ifepade that we should follow them . “ We travelled by sea for seveii days before we got back home . We - had earlier sent a message to inform the townspeople about our arrival . So , we were received at the harbor by a lot of people and many - qiieens were sent by the king to welcome us . The reunion of Ifepade ’s mother with her broughfto her mind a great joy . “ We proceeded to the palace to greet the king . After that , I went to stay in my former house and she stayed with her mother in the palace . The former house presented to me by the king had been la^vishly decorated . Thick mats and rugs were spread on its floors . Feathers were put in the cushion mattresses on my bed and chairs . All the plates and cups in the house were mdde of silver . The whole building was decorated with flowers ; the doors were as smooth as the surface of a mirror . The whole place was glittering ; the whole house looked beautiful . “ I slept in the hbuse till the next day . At daybreak , I went to , check Ifepade in the palace . When I arrived there , her eyes were red from weeping . I felt disturbed by the tears on her eyes . I greeted her but she reluctantly replied . All the letters I wrote her IREKE ONIBUDO
37695	37981	37692	37692	She	1783	‘ I have received all youf letters ; when she said this , I became downcast and took her to the bedroom and prostrated fully to be^ her . I so ijiuch begged her to forgive me * saying that the letters were written due to my ignorance about her whereabouts . I wiped off the tears on her face with a handkerchief ; she smiled and we played further . “ She later complained of headache and chid . I quickly made fire for her and rubbed her forehead with some ointment . She then laid down and slept off while I returned home to eat . “ I went to the palace in the evening and rnet her playing ; she had already recovered . But on the next day ’s morning , I heard a knock on my door . On peeping but , I saw someone sent from the palace by Ifepade to fell me that she was unable to sleep throughout the night . I quickly followed the messenger . She was given some curative medicine that aided her recuperation but she could not come out until a week after . “ Her relatives told me to prepare for our wedding a few days after her recovery . I did not want to do so because she looked emaciated . I did not want her indisposition aggravated by the restless preparations of marriage ceremony but when the king invited me and reiterated'it , I concurred and we got married . “ My friend , her sickness resumed six days after she came into my house ; it was so critical . She called me two months after and tearfully said , ‘
37991	38015	37692	37692	She	1783	’m going to die of this ailment . It is so painful that our romance would end this way . What a pity ! ’
38083	38307	38073	38073	I	0	' When lain in state , I laid with her and covered myself with -her burial clothes because my thought by then was to be dispossessed of my heart by a tragedy . I became apathetic to life , seeming ais if I had nothing in the world . The king and her mother broke down and fainted at once when they heard of her death . They were resuscitated tong after ! She was so much loved by the king . She was his first daughter - so famous . “ All the town people wore black clothes and followed her silvery casket during the burial . The arrangement for the burial procession went thus : her . corpse was to be buried in the palace . All the town people were to gather , lined up for procession and followed the casket from my house to the palace . “ The young children lined up at the front of the coffin , her ( Ifepade ) female friends ; her mother ’s friends and relatives ; the chiefs and I followed the casket respectively . I continued weeping . When we got to the palace and laid her in state , I cried loudly and became overtaken by emotion on recalling her conducts . I looked at her and mourned thus : ‘
38586	38726	38585	38585	I	0	’m tired of living because of you . I have fallen in love with heaven . ” “ That was how the woman died and I clad myself in sorrow in Alupayida . I became disinterested in the town after her death but the subsequent occurrences prevented my departure . The king himself did not want me to leave the town . He increased his love for me and eventually sent me to an important journey of which I will speak later , but the after effect of her death kept on haunting her mother for a very long time . She wept whenever she saw me . “ I have to tell you about a thing that surprised me and it happened this way . During - the lifetime of Ifepade , one of her step - mothers didn ’

Ifepade and I had met her that way before . She prepared a charm arid poured it in a bottle , and whoever ’s body it touched would be afflicted by leprosy . She brought the charm to the house on the day it was prepared with the aim of pouring it on Ifepade ’s mother in her sleep . She kept it on the shelf , laid down but never thought she could sleep off . Hardly had she lied down than she slept off . In the night , a fidgetifag cat hit the bottle of charm kept on the shelf and it poured on her as it fell . She became a leper before dawn and her fingers started cutting off .

Although , He was a sojourner but he had established himself there . He was a wise man . Contrarily , Kumofehinti s name is a synonym of insubordination because he was too stubborn ; He was a native of Alupayida - the child of a famous man but he was a troublesome person ; an incorrigible element . “ I had told the king about the outcome of our meeting . Several herbalists came to my house . I sacrificed one hundred and twenty pigeons ^t the meeting point “ of three roads ; I sacrificed sixty doves at my backyard ; seven hundred cuts of incisions were made on my head . I sacrificed nine goats , nine sheep and nine ducks to make my journey nice and smooth . I also prepared food for numerous children in my house to pave way for blessings . I sacrificed to the wizards , the witches and the spirits . A day was later appointed for the commencement of the journey . “ My companions had also prepared like me .

I turned rny face skyward and supplicated to the Almighty God to rescue us from the entanglement . We were not wicked to anyoiie and we harboured no malevolence against anyone in our destination .

On the sixth day , we arrived at a town . It was different from all the towns I had earlier .been . The difference was that it lacked women . We met only > men . The title of their king was Gbayegborun because he travelled to heaven daily . The settlement was an exponent of how the world would have looked like without women . If anyone of the natives wanted a child , he would inform Gbayegborun and give him his picture . He would take the picture to heaven and return with a child made to look like the sender . But I observed that the love between .children and their parents was little ; the children were rude to their parents because of the cheap way they got them . They did not value children because they were not responsible for their production . God bestows great honour on mankind by endowing them with procreative ability . * That means God allows them to contribute to man ’s creation . But , one other thing observed by me in the men ’s town was that they were barbaric . Some of them were running around in the town with apron ’s while some moved about naked in their homes .

Kumofehinti acted strongly and the goblin reacted fiercely and stubbornly . When he got hold of Kumofehinti , he started pushing him towards a rocky place to hit his head on it but he quickly freed himself He lifted up the right leg of the spirit and the spirit was limping . He later got hold of the neck of Kumofehinti and pressed it together with the aim to kill . A long time after that , Kumofehinti removed his hand from his neck and threw him forward . On landing , the goblin turned his horn frontally to stab him to death . He strongly rose.up his , club and hit the goblin ’s head . The spirit felt a serious pain and staggered backward . That was the time I removed my sword from the scabbard , moved furiously towards the goblin and struck it on the head . He was deeply cut but water was rushing out instead of blood . I struck him repeatedly as Kumofehinti clubbed him further . He later fell down and disappeared . He fell before our eyes but we were ignorant of how he went into oblivion . “ Five days after we left the settlement of men , we arrived at the women ’s town where there was no single man . The title of their king was Heavenly - bird . The procedure of their procreation was similar to that of men . Those seen by me did not preserve themselves as expected of women . Many of them moved about naked in their houses . All of them did not wear upper garments . They acted indifferently whenever the wrapper^ fell off their bodies , retying them openly on the streets .

Looking back , I nearly returned before Ero - okan held me back . Ero - okan and I were calling on Kumofehinti but he was adamant .

There was a locked door on the ground with a big snake placing its head on it . Ero - okan was the one that quietly used his hand to hold its neck and carry it aside .
