Thus interested foreign scholars have been impeded by the linguistic barrier which the native scholars have yet to remove complete^. When this is done , both the readership and the scholarship of Fagunwa 's corpus shoidd be widened . Thus far , only two translations of the first short chapter of Igbo Olodiunare(The Forest ofGod)}\sve been done . One was by A. A. Akinwowo , and the other jointly by both Bakare Gbadamosi and Ulli Beier.^ Wole Soyinka , Africa 's foremost novelist , poet , playwright , actor and stage director , has translated into English Fagunwa 's first novel , Ogboju Ode ninu Igbolrunmgleas The Forest of a Thousand Daemoi^s : A Hunter 's Sa^ , which was published by Nelstm in London in 1968 . These limited translations are the cmly material with which the non - Yoruba scholars can work . Therefore , there is an urgent need for more translations that '

We dwell with satisfaction upop a poet 's difference from his predecessors ; we endeavour to find somefiiing that can be isolated fa order to bp enjoyed . Whereas if we approach a poet -without this prejudice we shall find that not only the best , but the most individual parts of his work may be those in which the dead poets , his ancestors , assert their immortality more vigorously.^ Judged on this basis , Fagunfwa is most original even in the way he makes use of the material he imports fend employs in his works .

He provides an analysis of file drift in fte trend of literary creation in Africa ; thus he maintains that the essential direction of modem Afiican -writing , of the work of the truly significant writers , is towards the definition , in and through literature , of an imaginative apprehension and embodiment of an African spirit.^ ® 3

Their work expresses the essence of myth as a comprehensive metaphor of life : as a reformulation of experience at the level of image and symbol so as to endow it with an intense spiritual significance . " In the last analysis , Irele 's article unveils the significance of these writers as eloquent articulators of the African mode pf thought and sensibility ; that they stand as the '

He first demonstrated his versatility , remarkable genius and productivity when he wrote his first novel for a creative writing contest , the contest which he won creditably , as Bamgbose notes that Fagunwa 's first novel Ogboju Ode ninu Igbo Inmmole was written for a competition organized by Miss Plumber in 1936 . The Church Missionary Society bought the manuscript for £ 20 ( twenty pounds sterling ) and published it in 1938 . The book was an instant success , and was very ■ popular especially in the schools . ® ® The above excerpt about the history of Fagunwa 's Ogboju Ode Ninu Igbo Iruninole is another due , apart from the moralistic nature of the Yoruba folklore , to his propensity to overload his narratives with excessive -didacticism , a trait for which he is faulted by some of his critics . ® ® Within a very short time in Fagunwa 's literary career , he had five major novels and other publications to his credit . His five major novels indude : Ogboju Ode ninu IgJ > o Irunmgle Nelson , 1950 ( first published by the CMS Bookshop , Lagos , 1938 ) ; Jgbo Olodumare , Edinburg : Nelson , 194^ Ireke Onibudc^ Edinburgh : I^elson , 1954 ; Adiitu Olodunuue , Edinburg : Nelson 1961 ; Irinkerindo ninu Igbo Elegbeje , Edinburg : Nelson , 1964 . The significance of Fagunwa 's work lies not only in his literary prowess and his vividness of imagination alone , but in his basic thought pattern , the thought pattern which is immersed in the tradition and culture of his Yoruba ethnic group . It is in this philosophical dimension that he is able to transcend the limitation of his culture"and his traditional heritage , in order to universalize the scope of his aesthetics . Therefore , it is not amiss to briefly examine this fiiou^t pattern in order to determine the way he uses it to transcend his culttue . Whatever imported material Fagunwa Weaves into the total fabric of his narratives ( for according to Bamgbose 's clo?e analyses of Fagunwa 's novels , he draws from three major sources : '
5158	5193	5153	5153	Fagunwa	187	’’ grounded in his own world - view , the world - view which is also informed by his culture and tradition . To him , the nature of reality is not limited to the ’

10979	11024	10831	10831	he	271	' , and he invites them to go with him on his imaginative journey through the story . He states plainly that the story is an allegory through the metaphorical use of the agidigbo drum ; by doing that , he is really saying that '
11224	11226	11247	11247	he	0	' improved '
11255	11287	11247	11247	he	0	' Come , go with me , as I journey into the forest of the universe ; r^son with me , as I penetrate into the abyss of the human soul . '

The desire to achieve ttiis objective , however , demands a specification of a philosophy of translation , and a careful choice of a method '
11733	11739	11731	11731	Nida	293	' the principle of equivalent effect '
11778	11902	11908	11909	the narrator	4122	' This method necessitates a literal translation which keeps the sense of words and expressions wjthin the cultural perspective of me original language without blurring the intelligibility of the content in English , so that the content is communicative as well . In other words , the literalness of the translation does not jeopardize its being sensible to the reader of the English edition , and though some words have taken new senses , figurative or metaphorical sinpe they emanate from the culture of the original language of the text ( Yoruba ) , where the intelligibility is somewhat m danger , the annotation is used as a means of protection . Such situations can be instanced in several places in the text . ’

The trees that have long fallen had no more power in them ; mushrooms were growing around their stumps . The paths of animals differed from one another : the rat 's path was narrow and dean , but the wart - hog 's path was very wide indeed . My friend , it is better seen than be told ; you know all kinds of difficulties in the forest , and my father saw all those difficulties with his eyes as he was going on his way to Igbo Olodumare ; yet these things that Ihave adurnbrated were nothing compared with what he experienced when he got to Igbo Olodiunare . ‘
19875	20335	20358	20359	the daemon	1110	' My father spent the first night on the road , and by noon the second day , he v^as almost at his destination . My father reached the forest that was next to Igbo Olodumare ; the name of the forest was the Jungle of Silence , for it was the most silent place under the heavens . There was only one gnome in this jungle ; he was hotter than the thimder from the sky . The gnome never let anybcxly cross over to Igbo Olodumare . He gave the hunters a lot of trouble , although he was not taller than two feet . He Jived under .an ant - hill . He was a short devilish daemon ; he carried a bundle of whips around everyday of his life . When my father reached tills forest , everything was deadly silent ; all the leaves on the trees bowed their heads down - ward , one did not touch the other ; if was just as if there were no wind at all ; all the branches of the trees stood strai^t up like an army before a supreme commander ; the liana looked siddy where they coiled themselves ; even the animals had deserted the place as tiieir place of abode ; the birds had headed towards other places of their choice . All the living tilings looked like a debtor absorbed in thou^t about his debt . The whole forest was . very silent as if someone was bereaved and friends and acquaintances kept silent around him . You see , my friend , since my father was alone witii this little daemon ( which lived luider the ant - hill ) in this vicious forest , his crossing over must be very difficult indeed . After my father had wandered around this big jungle for some time , he and this little daemon under the ant - hill saw each other face to face . It was an eventful day indeed , when they finally faced each other . An accident met witii trouble ; sigidi ( graven image ) met witii daemon ; two lions met face to face . The name of this daemon is Esu - kekere - ode,-^ ! he did not wear a gown nor put on trousers ; he never wore cap nor pants ; the hard - headed fellow covered his bottom with leaves . He had only one eye , and tiiat eye was as around as a large rounded moon . Esu- kekere - ode had no nose at all because his eye was abnormally big ; his mouth was as wide as the palm of a hand ; his teetii wer~ Uke those of

" A.S he was approaching his steps were jingling because of die chain of snail shells diat had been cracked into pieces , each piece as round as a shilling and they were tied togedier like beads that the daemon coiled around his ankles up to his very knees ; so were the steel rings vdiich were on all his fingers that were ds black as die fingers of a woman who works with indigo . Ha ! I tell you , a terrible daemon was the little gnome of die ant - hill , whose name was Esu - kekere - ode.- " When my father appeared on diis side and he emerged on that side , they bodi halted and began to stare at each other because when an elephant meets an elephant , trees must fall , one upon the other . He was approaching my father , and my father was al^ going to fneet him ; and when they were about to meet each other , both of them stopped and started to gaze at each other again ; something was indeed about to happen . It was Esu - kekdre - ode that spoke first ; he opened his big mouth and said : " Who are you ? What are you ? What do you amount to ? What have you become ? What are you wordi ? What are you looking for ? What do you want ? What are you looking at ? What are you seeing ? What are you thinking ? WhaV s matter with yoi^ ? Where are yoiT coming from ? Where are you going ? Where are you hiking ? Where are you walking ? Answer me , son of a man , answer me in one sentence ! Certainly you are in trouble today ; you have climbed the tree beyond its top ; you have fallen from die top into the well ; youhave consumed a poison unexpectedly ; you have planted your peanuts on an unweeded farm . You aphasic man ; do n't you know that a lion and an antelope do not see eye to eye , and that a leopard and a cow are never friends , and that on die day that a cat sees a rat , that is the end of the raf s life ?

He was kxiking for a way to lift the horrible gnome off the ground , over the crown of his head , and throw him far away , so that Esu - kekere - ode would bounce from one heaven to the ottier . However , these things were impracticable , for as he was putting up a fi^t like a lion , so was Esu - kekere - ode , like an elephant ; and the 41

A cool - headed person sees fight and stays away , and'a fool thinks he is weak , but when the patient person starts fighting , everybody begins to fall like the trees ( in the forest ) . I am grateful to you for the mdancholic song that you sang , die song that reminded nye of the One who created ; if it were not because of the song that you sang , I would have fought you three days , for I have fought like that before ; I might have fought six months ; I have fought for as long as three months ; I have also fought a fight which lasted for a whole year before even I , the little gnome of the ant - hill , the one whose name is Esu - kekere - ode . "- Thus did the gnome Speak , and my father was not angry anymore ; they shook hands with each - other , and everyone went on his way . But as it is with our culture/ fighting'never goes without the fighter being hurt , whether the one invdlved in the fight was at fault or not . My father bumped against a tree / And tore his hunter 's bag ; he lost his important medicine , and his flute got broken . Also , Esu - kekere - ode was wounded , lost two of his teeth , and orie ring ; one of his legs was broken , and he w^ limping around like a guinea - worm victim .

The story is not too interesting when I tell it ; if you heard it directly from my father 's mouth you would have been greatly amazed , for ( while they were fitting ) , they uprooted the roots of the trees and broke stems of trees witfl their feet , tiiey uprooted the shrubs , and their feet sounded on the ground like a drum . They were all wet as if they were beaten by the rain . But after a long time < rf continuous fitting , they separated , sat down , , and rested . " As they were resting , the gate - keeper 's wife brought food for her husband and brought water along with it also . When Olowo - aiye 's wife , who had remained a bird heretofore , saw this , she changed and became a human being , got food from her pocket and gave It to her 54
30903	31237	31243	31243	husband	4154	' food they continued their fi^t . ( As the fight progressed ) , smoke started ooming out of the crown of the gnome 's head and this scared the people very much . But before they started fighting the second time , fee beings' ® ^ in Igbo Olcxlumare had gathered together very closely . God is a mighty King ; my father experienced all kinds of troubles ; Olowo - aiye is very much of a man indeed . The : fi^t continued to be intensive , because the matter was beginning to take a shameful shape since both their wives were standmg by , watching their husbands . You , my scribe , don'tyou think that one needs to put more effort into'such a fig^t ? He who wants to throw a person on tire ground in the presence of the person 's wife do n't you see that that person is determined to bring shame on tire person ? When the fighting is finished , the diame will still remain ; then one would not dare to get into any argument with one 's wife , or else tire wife would rush upon the husband ( to hudi him ) . And when it comes to the point that file wife darts upon a husband ( to beat him up ) , and vfiien it oomfes to the point fiiat the wife slaps the husband and kiciffi file husband and tfte husband beginsto run into the room and file badyaid , and file woriian begins to twist file husband 's shirt around his neck , and file wife begins to dhange the husband 's orders ; and when the wife ^bea out without telling die hudiand and when we ask where file wife is coming fiom , and she replies by shunning one throu^ facial expresabist , dori't you see that something is indeed wrong there ? " Ahd if a wife looks at the husband contemptuously , all those 55
31260	31328	31338	31338	he	548	’ gate - keeper,*'chaos and unrest filled - the air in the forest . Wliat really vitiated eVpiy thing were tli « big drums ^d tom - tom^^ which die gnomes of Igbo Olodumare brought to the place of the fight before the sdoorid round of the fight start^. The gnomes were beating ^e druihs , and the'^idil^ and the mc^eys were beating the bong6s , and when ’
31343	31352	31338	31338	he	548	' hegari to iht^ify^tii&r praise drumming , saying:^^ " ‘
31368	31564	31356	31358	Olowo - aiye	283	’ aftafck him , collide with him , attack him , the ^n of Akowediran,^^ the son of Akowe- diran , Olowo - aiye , Olowo - aiye ca n't you perforrh like your'father ? Olowo - aiye , Olo^o - aiye are you healthy ? Are you healthy ? Is there any trouble ? Is there any trouble ? Olowo - aiye , Olowo - aiye there is a big cudgel on your right hand side and a load of whips on your left ; the fall of the gnome is on the peak of the rock.^^ Olowo - aiye , hold the arm of the fairy , hold the feet of the gnome;^ lift the fairy off the ground completely . Olowo - aiye , Olowo - aiye the eyes of die gnomes are on you ; the eyes of humans are watching you ; all the living beings are gadiered , filling Igbo Olodumare complete , etc . , etc . ® ® Thus the ( talking ) drum sounded intensively and both of them were panting as the ground was shaking terribly , and all the forest came to a complete silen ’
31584	31679	31356	31358	Olowo - aiye	283	' completely , and’lie put it on his shoulder . My father also supported himself with his left leg as die gnome tried to push him into die pit’so he would fall into it — he would have filled the pit to the brim — but that was impossible , for before he pushed my father intp the pit ) my father had extricated his rightleg out of his grip , and had Stood firmly on the ground ; and when he took a look at the.gome 's eyes he burst"into laughter and said , '
31693	31908	31356	31358	Olowo - aiye	283	' and all the gnomes shouted . It was after this that my father stooped down and carried the gate - keeper on his shoulder and was moving ( toward a rock ) hoping to dash his back against a huge rock which was close by , but before he got to die rock , that fellow had made a monkey - like tumble from his shoulder and had stood on the ground , very firmly , and the gnomes beat their dnuns for joy , rejoicing with die gate - keeper for being so lucky . . - After a while , this , gnome was angry , so he was .determined to show hirnself as a.gnome ; Ke^jtiang^.^d became a lion . Since my father was not only a young hunter lie behaved like an adult hunter : he took the fruit which lus wife / s older sister gave Kim ( and ) put it in his mouth . Thus he also , changed and became , a lion . So lion began to fight lion , and all the forest was filled with bromirig ( voices of these lions ) , and the grjomes in Igbo Olodumare begaii to run , around .

Immediately , they took his hunting garment off my father 's neck . And they put one big flowing garment on his neck ; they gave him ( native ) trousers made out of velvet , and put a cap made Out of velvet — with a top pointed like a crown , ornamented with gold which glittered brightly — on his head . They put shoes made of brass on his feet . A gold ring was put on his finger . A chain made out of gold was put on his neck . After this , they put a staff of beads in his hand . They also took his betrothed wife , and they adorned her from head to the sole of her feet — the body of that one ( the wife ) was very clean and was as beautiful as the rainbow on the sky . The woman 's teeth were shining like a bright noon - sunshine . This was the only woman that befitted my father in the glory of this Igbo Olodumare . Yes , it is I who told you . My father was a very handsome man ; only if anyone wants to scoff ( would he then deny this fact ) ; I did not just say that because he was my father , for even the people of our town sang about him ( his Kmdsomeness ) . They used to say of him : '

34462	34950	34456	34456	He	548	' I ate and my stomach got terribly protruded like that of a baby bird : a big stomach that drove the navel all the way inside . My hip became big and bulky . My wife could not go throu^ a narrow doorway anymore , because her legs were fatter than the cement pillars of a budding ; and her hip was ^heavy enough to be a full load for six muscular men . And the back o ) her peck was as big as the size of eight people put together . She hersell had changed the way she walked : she lifted her legs at intervals as she walked along , like those of a grazing cow , and she never behaved like a small person anymore : she was behaving like the wife of an important person ( in the society ) . Noble men do not want to walk like the common nien ; wealthy people do not want to walk like the poor people , and women love to hluff very much . My wife 's older sister changed too , for her face was smooth like the young leaves on a lime tree , and her entire body was clean and ligHt like the body of . a three - day old baby , for all of us ate tasty and nutritious food ; We ate delicious soup ; we ate the arms of animals ; we ate the livers of animals ; we ate ( chicken ) gizzards , and we also ate their adam 's apples too . " " This was the way my father used to tell the story , all of us would laugh ; all of us would somersault ; all of us would roll around on the floor . “ On my father 's wedding day , there was a big merriment forough- out Igbo Olodumare . There were all kinds of food in the king 's palace ; there were poundted yam with okra soup and meat , rice and melon oil prwared with onion and pepper , and a jumbo with 1 soup filled with meat . Beans with small fish and shrimp caught in die ocean , which they had roasted and had dried stiff , were cooked together and were placed around . Fried yams were nothing , and no one cared for fried plantain on this wedding day . And we can not count all the contemporary foods like butter and bread and all kinds of European cake up to biscuits of today which wise women make out of coconut and European salt . Big drums and savi .seker^^^ and tom - tom , violin and bok^^'^ and all other kinds of drums made by both black and white people , all these things were brought to this party : it was a great day ( indeed ) .

35845	36313	35838	35838	he	548	' Your Highness , may God prolong your life , may the Lord allow you to live long on earth . Death will never sever your life , and disease will never tie you up ; you will live to be old , you will live to be straight,^^ ! and you will be our father for a long time . I want you to know that all those tilings that you have done , you have not done them for me : you have done them for God toe ( heavenly ) King.^22 j gm certain that as it is true that toe wicked stiall reap wickedness , so it is also true that toe good people shall reap goodness . I know what you have done for me , and your reward is in toe hands of the Creator of all tilings ; your benefit will come from toe dome of heaven . The sky is filled with toe showers of blessings , and they will be shower^ on you . Your Highness , be mindful of toose destructive pests that eat up toe crops : as toey spoil yam,^23 gg they spoil banana , arid they do not allow com to cob with grains ; God is only speaking to us in parables , for so are the thankless people . They are like vicious pests ; toey always eat up their neighbour 's roots , so tiiat that one would not grow up , so that one would stand still like stagnant water . He to whom kindness is done and make 's nothing of it , is like toe one whose life is saved from an accident and sees one 's ( his rescuer 's first son ) first - bom male and shoots him ( dead ) ; toe judgement of such a person is not in toe hands of man : it is in the hands of God ( the heavenly ) King . Your highness , I know toe good things you have done for me . May God enable me to show you torough my actions that I have placed you in an important spot in my heart . “ Thus my father had spoken ; he thanked his benefactor , and that one ( toe Idn^ was happy that he did not show kindness to an ingrate and did not put a gown around a pig 's neck ; he did not put pants orfa baboon ; ndtiier did he wnq > cupped underwear around the waist of a woman , and he did not promote a hypocrite as toe chairman of a union ; nettoer did he make a treacherous person toe moderator of a meeting , anc^ he did not take care of an underserving person.l^S 63

This is not true of another person to whom much more had been done , and on die next day , he began to look at one right on the tip of one 's nose . And when one asked : '
36586	36592	36593	36593	Doi	374	' he answered and said , '
36598	36993	36593	36593	Doi	374	' Therefore , I want you to know that which I did for you yesterday was small ( compared to that which is coming in the future ) , may God spare our lives ; may He grant that we know ea^h other for a long time ; for when there is life , everydiing else is trivial ; life surpasses everydiing else . But I want to tell you somediing — there is so much sorrow among the sons of men , so much that we gnomes do not want to live among them . If it were not because the children of the world ( try to ) endure sorrow , they would be taking their own lives every day . God loves mankind , but man alienates himself from God the ( heavenly ) King , and a sinner does not go unpunished ; the sins of the diildr^ of the world do not allow diem to enjoy the world . If you are interested in hunting , take your gun and go hunting ; you can always come back to the palace to pass the night . I Would like you to think over - this matter ; for it does not behove the young to reject the suggestions of the adult^^ ? except if the suggestion is misleading . Once more , I thank you for your coming ; greet your wife for me , and greet her older sister as well . " This was the way the king spoke to my father , and , as it behoved him , my father also tiianked him ; he also promised that he would go home .and put the matter before his wife , and after they had deliberated on it , he would bring an answer to the king . After this they greeted each other , the king entered into the room , and my father also got out ( of the house ) . " When my father got home , he told his wife , and when both of them thou^t about it , they agreed to stay with the king for a long time and , if possible , they would make the place their permanent place of abcxle . This was the way tiie first important part of my fatiier 's biography ended . '

Therefore , I think foat I sljould start to write my autobiography down , because my eyes have seen some ­ thing in the past . This king 's behaviour has shown me ( the fact ) foat whatever one 's eyes have seen in foe world ought to be written down for those who are coming after ( to read ) , because foe world is filled with pits , plain fields , and hills .

You rat of Ig^ Olodu- mare , you are small in the sight of men ( though you are bigger than a pouch rat found in some places ) , but I want you to know one thing : you are not small in the sight of God the King . You are not a hypocrite who keeps blood inside , and spits white saliva out;^^^ who praises a person in his presence , and slanders him behind his back . My dear rat , let me tell you a little story : one day ahypocrite and I were in a union ; when he observed that one man was going to spoil tire union , all of us unanimously agreed that he should leave the union . Immediately after we dismissed tire meeting , he secretly sneaked to the man and told him that he was not part of the plan against tire man . At lorrg last , all the members of tire union heard about it , and tire hypocrite felt very ashamed . When we asked ( him ) about the matter , the hypocrite answered like a stammerer . We all felt like dropping his head off . My dear rat , you are irot like tiris , and I am begging you todemonstrateyour ri^teousness to me add deal witir me in your truthfulness and tell me plainly tire way lean get myself down from tiris confinement , vdrere ( my ) stupidity has taken me , oirtire very top here .

Please be careful so that a tree does not hit you on your head , so that it will not be blcavn out and you consequently become a pilgrim to heaven . My speech to you is not more than this . I am now going to look for food ; after I have eaten food , I shall come back to see you ; goodbye .

42081	42660	42063	42063	I	0	' I made a home out of a cave . After it had been a while since I had been living in the cave , I repaired it very well , and I made all kinds of rooms out of it . I made my bedstead separately ; I gathered small leaves with lots of large leaves . I made a pillow out of this ( covered leaves ) which I put on my bedstead . I got a huge rock with which I made a door . I made small holes on the top of fixe cave , which became windows . Even though my cave was made of rock on all sides , a part of its top was earth ; that part was the part in which I made my holes . The big animals that were living in fixe hol^ before my arrival had left the place since I had been there . " As I was going around in the forest , I found a lot of snails . It was their shells that I was using to fetch water , and I lined them up in rows in my cave . This was what I was doing , enjoying the little happiness that I had as I continued to go on with my life ( in the forest ) . " When it had been eight months since I came in the forest , a very strong wind blew one day , fixe wind was so strong that the air was filled with debris . As I was looking up ; I sudderxly saw a sheaf of com which was being carried aroxind by the wind , and I was observing where the sheaf of com was going to fall . When it fell , it fell on a little stream which was flowing , but which was getting dry . So I began to pursue the sheaf of com very quickly , xintil it came to one liarxa which was on some stagnant water ; it was there that I caught up with it , and I picked it up . The reason why I followed fixe sheaf of com was that I wanted to lopk at it ( closely ) to be able to determine whether or not it came from a place close by . By this , I might see a sign that would assure me that I could still get out of my confinement . " When I looked at the sheaf of com , I could not see any sign which indicated to me that it came from a place close to me at all , because all my observations showed that it came from a place very far away from Igbo Olodxxmare . But a thing of joy which I found in this sheaf of com when I examined it very closely , was a dried grain of com . When I thought ( seriously ) for a long time about what I could possibly do witix this grain of com and could not find anything ( I could do with it ) , I said , " Please God , teach me the wisdom about what to do wifix this grain of com . " After this , I took the sheaf of com into my cave , and I slept xintil the next morning . When it was dawn , it seemed as if 73

The com brought fortfl more grains ( on the cob ): it brought forth two big cobs . When they came to maturity . I did not eat them ; I kept them until they were dried,- and both had a lot of grains . When the raining season came , I planted all the grains that I had on one large farm which I made , and when my com came to maturity , I began to eat . But whoever saw * me at this time would not be able to recognise me , because my clothes were filthy ; it was true I tried to wash them in the water , but it did not work , because there was no soap . I bathed , but leaves were my sponge;^^ the worst of all tilings about me was that the hair on my head and my eyes were covered with hair to the point that it seemed as if my hair had built a home for my eyes .

" A^r a while , I came into one fruit garden : it was full of all kinds of sweet fruits , those that I had tasted since die day I had been lost ( in the forest ) . I saw pawpaw , orange , pineapple , mango , red bananas , lime , and all kinds of trees which came to the land from die four comers'of the world . " I looked around to see if these fruits belonged to someone . Smre Igbo Ofodumare was filled with strange things , I thought die orchard was there for the welfare of those who got lost in tiie forest , so I began to eat . After I had eaten and was very full , I sat and leaned my back on a tree , and I slept . " I was deeply asleep , because I was tired before I slept . As I'began to dream a sweet dream , somebody woke me up . When I opened my eyes , I saw the fellow ; he was a very handsome young man who wore a white gown and had a white cap on and.white pants , too . I greeted him , and he greeted me too . After he had greeted me , he asked me a question , and he said , " What are you looking for in die midst of our garden ? " , I answered and I said , " How many of you does the garden belong to ? " 75

" But I observed the way thq man went ; after a while , I looked that it was about to rain again ; within a short w^le , I began to hear some noise . It was only the noise of the wind . When the wind blew over me , my eyes saw a lot of trouble , because this Wind was even stronger than the one that drove me out of my cave . When the wind reached me , ( what happened ) was beyond what a mouth could describe : all fhe trees were bumping their heads against each other ; liana was bumping against liana ; the leaves filled the air ; and palm leaves were naked ; trees were squeaking , and a host of them '

When this woman got close to me arid reached where th © brass ( skinned ) lion was standing , she said , " You , the Creator 's lion , the lion of brass , you to whom a command was given to guard the gate of the graves , get out of the way for me . I took permission from God before I left heaven ; I have crossed a black sea which is the Sea of Indigo ; I have passed through the red sea which is the Sea of Blood , and I have told thousands of the dead who are expecting the judgement of God the King .

At the end of the matter , onetof these men viciously dealt with her ( in vengeance ): he used a deadly medicine^^^ against her , and the lady 's blood ceased to flow , and when her heart did not beat anymore , I went to do the job given to me by God : I took her soul ( out of her body ) , and there was a great sorrow in her home . 89

He called this man and arranged with him to tap palm wine^^l on these palm trees ; after tapping the wine , and after selling the wine , the proceeds should be divid^ equally ( between both of them ) . He gave tills poor man some money which he needed to buy some gourds and all wine tapping equipment . This man was happy , and he got ready one day , and he went to th © farm ; he tapped the wine,'and he tied those gourds around tiie trunk of the palm trees , with tiie hope that on tiie next day when he got tiiere , he would find wine in those gourds , and he would sell the wine , and he and the wealthy man would share the proceeds equally . On tiie next day , when this man went to check the gourds , he found them broken on me ground . This mystified , bipi greatly , and it was a very painful experience for him . '
58062	58147	58053	58053	he	2441	' " This man found another means to get some money with which he bought other gourds , and he decided to watch and see what was breaking his gourds ; thus after he had tapped the wine , he did not go home ; he climbed to the top of a tree , watching what would happen to his gourds . He waited until dusk ; still he did not see anything ; but still he did not go ( home ) . , '
58216	58422	58425	58425	he	2446	' " When this strange creature came to those palm trees , he began to climb them one by by one , taking the wine on top of them ; after he had turned the wine from the gourd into the big gourd which he brought , he would throw the gourd to the ground , and the gourd would break . Thus he was breaking the gourds one by one as he went from one to the other As the strange creature was doing this , this man shouted greatly , and when he had shouted , this creature took his big gourd of palm wine , and he began to run along . The man was also running after him . The moon was like the noon daylight ; they ran ( all night ) until dawn , still the man did not turn back , he kept pursuing him , and he pursued him until they got to the foot of a mountain ; this man followed him again , as he finished climbing this mountain to the top there , this man foimd himself in foe midst of all kinds of animals in fois world ; they were in their council .

He spoke about how he was once a poor man , and that his poverty was so much that he never had more than one under- wear^^ in the world , and that his wife did not have more than one drawer , and that the money he used to have on hand at a time never exceeded three pence,^^ and he never slept at night , because of much 100

" '
60189	60606	60607	60607	My	0	' " You , my friend , after he had died , they took that woman and hanged her on die tree . " This is what the world is like , you , my friend : some people would marry death into the house with money,^^ and would say that they have married women ; some people would marry debt , and they- would say that they have married wives . Some people would , because of greed , lose the love of an important wife . A wife 's matter is not a jovial matter , for whatever pertains to one 's home is no more a trivial matter . If a person wants to have a wife , it behoves die fellow to think very deeply , and he should entreat God to guide him , because a mother is different from a wife , and a father is different from one 's woman . A woman is a snail shell , afid a husband is die snail : wherever the snails goes , it goes with - die shell.237 Once marriage is started , trouble has started ; as wives multiply , the love would continue to dwindle , and a host of men are living with ( their bitter ) enemies , whom they call women . Act according to your capacity , you , my friend;238 that your wife loves you before she enters your house . It is true diat you are the one who should first ask her to many you before she responds to you , but be sure that she herself loves you . And you should not also behave like the hypocritical man about whom the women pray that God should not let them come dieir way . " By die same token , there are many envious people in this our world , and there is no way in which they can not show their envy . The one who is unhappy about other people 's progress is an envious person . If a person is in the position of being a head^^ an envious person always looks for every means to show tiiat that person is not fit for the post , arid he would forget that he whom God has exalted , nobody can bring him down forever . " Thus did Baba - Onirungbon speak his words , and when he finished those words , I answered , and I said , '
60684	61071	60681	60681	he	398	' Look at that tree over there , the tree whose leaves are deeply green over there . Look at its flowers again ; see how beautiful they are also . After that , look at the right hand side near the tree , you will see another tr^ which is a little smaller ; you will see that bofli of them resemble each other . Observe both of them very well , because I want to say something to you about them . " ^ter he had thus spoken , I also answered ; I said , Ihave seen fliem , they resemble each other ; they are like twins among all the trees in that vicinity , therefore go on with your talk . " After I had said this , die man continued his talking , he said , Olowo - aiye , those two trees that you have seen were human beings before . The older of the two was a boy , the second one was a girl . The two of them loved each other very much , and they wanted to marry each other , so that they would become husband and wife , but the parents of both of them did not want them to many each other , because there was no agreement among those parents . Still this young boy and the young girl were like the tongue and the mouth to each other , and they used to talk to each other lhrough.a hole on the wall . If the girl put her ear in the hole on the wall on one side , the boy would talk to her from the other side . If the boy put his ear in the mouth of the hole in his room , the ^rl would talk to him from over { here . My friend , it is I who have told you ; there is no way that two lovers can exist without having a difficulty between them . Love does not walk without stumbling a little , but a complete love always turns a mountain to a plain ground ; he always walks carelessly in the middle of thorns , and he wiU run fast in the midst of pot - holes and hillocks . '
61072	61101	60681	60681	he	398	' Thus those two decided to run away from home and go to another town , so that they could live togeflier according to the love of tiieir heart;2 ‘
61374	61433	61363	61363	she	2543	' Soon after this , the boy came and he did not see his female lover , instead of this , he found his lover 's clothe on the ground , awfully stained with blood . When he saw this , he thought that his lover had died , he burst into bitter weeping , he said ; " '
61596	61906	61922	61922	he	2557	' they were scolding me , you did not scold me , when they were conspiring against me , you did not conspire against me ; it was you that I made as my pride bef<^ friends ; it was you that 1 made as a provocation^'*^ before those who knew me ; it was you about whom I was boasting in the midst of all well - known people . As you dealt widi me in my presence , so you did behind my back also . Wherever you saw my people you honoured them ; whenever there were visitors , you were always takine care of them with joy . I only gave you money whenever I had any.^ I gave you gift only whenever it was within my ability to give you a gift , ^d you haA never put my matter down , scolding me behind my back io the midst of your playmates ; I always found you wherever I left you , you had not married me and then begun to whisper to another person in the secret afterwards , and I have never caught you in any hypocrisy since the day we have been dating each other . You have respected me the way you should respect me ; you have played with me at the right time of playing ; you sympathized with me at the time of sympathizing ; thus you have never told me , even one day , what 1 could do ( for you ) . What remains for me after all these ? What remains for me then ? For you to go and me to remain in the world or what ? Not me ! A tortoise never goes with his shell left behind ; wherever the snail goes it goes with its shell .2'*^ " '
61948	62053	61922	61922	he	2557	' As this boy kept silenP'*^ his lover came out from the hole in which she was hiding , no person could tell how great the sorrow was , when she saw the corpse of her lover . On the same spot , she fell down , and she was downhearted to the extent that she died for nothing . " The story of their death spread to all parts of the world at that time , and God the ( heavenly ) King turned both of them to those two trees which you are looking at there — the trees whose leaves are cool 103
62103	62320	62088	62088	they	2560	' " Behold , my friend , when love is hot , it is like the sea water that rises up and covers the sand . Love always covers the faces of those who love each other . Love is like palm wine from the palm tree with which a man has been drunk which begins to intoxicate him , which h^ turned him into a mad man , which makes him unconscious of what he is doing . Many women always turn deaf ears to their relatives when love boils over , and - spills oVer their faces like hot water which boils over and covers the yam flour .247 It behoves the young boys and young girls to open their eyes very well , and beg God the ( heavenly ) King to direct diem to the ( right ) way before they begin to love someone/ * " Faces and clothing are the things the young children of today focus upon for which they love people : this is a complete act of sapidity . A child who does not think deeply befpre he lets love ride him like a horse , when love had pushed him in die pit , .his arms and feet would fill up the pit to th^ brim . ''
62357	62696	62354	62354	I	0	' My dear Baba - Onirungbon - yeuke , I thank you very much , I thank you , and I thank yoti again , for die more a person accumulates days over his head , the more wisdom in his head would continue to increase .249 . Are n't you going to ask why I said that ? I have been surprised since yod have been talking today , as I heard the big words which were in your mouth , and I was noting the important words which were in your throat . When I thought a little while about these words , I almost wept for children , because^ey are not afraid of the elders anymore : they are wise in their own eyes.^ They are dying like fire , and they are falling sick unawares ; still they would not think and take note of the words of those of you who are elders , so that diey would increase ( dieir ) wisdom , so that they would increase ( their ) knowledge , so that they would recognise the stump which caught the feet of the ones before them , so that they too would not fall into a bottomless pit . Thus it is a lie : a partridge that compares Itself with a hen is playing with death ; a child that compares himself with adults is pulling trouble 's leg ( toward himself ) , 25'1 for a child 's stomach is shallow , and the stomach of an adult is deeper than the sea water .2'52 Therefore , my great Baba - Onirungbon - yeuke , I thank you very very much . Go on with your talk ; it is very delightful to me ; I am not tired of it . After I had said this , he looked at me for a while ; he shook his head up and down , and he said , ^You , young child , you are very wise . '253

" When I said this , Baba - Onirungbon told us that truly there was a road by which we could go to our house , but he told us that also that the road was verydangerous indeed .

In other words , ftie emotional depth of the subjunctive mood here is preserved by giving it such a literid tarnation . Ajgdiran ( aje - dwran ) literally means witch - becomes - generation . Idiomatically expressed , one would say witchcraft runs - in - the - family . It is a comihon thing in most African cultures to think that someone is responsible for the other person 's death through tire use of witchcraft ; So , Fagunwa is being both realistic as well as satiric here . Qmg . araiye literally means the children of the world , but is both semantically and communicatively acceptable to render it as " the people . " In Yoruba culture , as it is probably true of most African cultures , a woman does not propose to a man . That is , it does not make any difference at all ; in other words , " what difference does it make , if a man or a woman makes the first move ? " 151
93428	93645	93685	93685	Omgliikbi	494	' if you feed your husband , I can feed mine , too . " 91 . Fagunwa 's didacticism is heightened to the level of sermonisation in this paragraph;Lt is also anothCT narrative embellishment which always interrupts the continuous flow of his narratives . 92 . nkan is better translated " beings " here instead of the literal meaning " things " . 93 . gangan is a native talking drum . 94 . The Yoruba and Nupe people use a talking drum to praise local , regional or national heroes very much . This art is a powerful psychological tool for motivation in those cultures . 95 . Akdwediran mean " literacy runs in the family . " Literally translated , it means " letter - writing - runs in the generation . " 96 . That is , dash him against die peak of the rock . 97 . Fairy and gnome are used interchangeably for the purpose of rhythm — my own liberty . 98 . This is a type of epideictic or praise song for which die talking drum is used . It is ^ways inspiring . 99 . Here again , we see Fagunwa 's didacticism heightened to die level of epigrammatism and allegory . The figh^ symbolises die complexity of 153

See Note No . 8 on yam . 124 . is a handwoven fabric which is very expensive and is used on special occasions and festivals like marriages , naming ceremonies and festivals like Christmas and other Moslem festivals . 125 . Fagunwa 's extended metaphor here serves to intensify the idea that the thing has done good things to the one who both appreciates and , deserves ( by the virtue of his personality ) such a gesture . 126 . Ipo literally means place ; metaphorically , however , it means '
94997	95057	95117	95117	Iwo	3835	' * * as the saying goes . 135 . This is a didactic means of warning the reader against keeping one*s Sn h 1 ” without bringing it out by discussing it with those who 136 .

This means he has fumbled ; he has made a great mistake ! 158 . That is " do not forget to speak the truth always , and in aU circum ­ stances , it should always be within you , for it is stronger than any magical power ( charm ) . " 159 . The word aseni - bani - ddro is a compound word meaning he who tries to undo one and comes round to sympathise with one when one is in pain as a result of his double - dealing . 160 . In Yoruba culture , it is believed that one 's in - laws are like a lion who should not be ill - treated or taken lightly . Instead , they should be respected and loved whole - heartedly . Thus , anything that would tarnish one 's image before them shouldbe eschewed . This relationship , of - course , is reciprocative between the son - in - law and the parents - in - law . This kind of relationship also includes all the members of the immediate and distant family of the wife too . 161 . Here again , as usual , we see a heavy - handed didacticism in Fagunwa 's narrative . The tone here is that of an educator who seeks to instruct his students on the ideals of family life in terms of the responsibilities on the parts of both parents and children . 162 . Fagunwa 's Judeo - Christian concept of life after death is in consonance with his Yoruba belief that there is life on the other side after death . This is strongly supported by African Traditional Religion as well . 163 . This echoes the Biblical narration of the story of Jesus in the Garden of Gethsemane . See Matthew 25:36 - 46 ; Mark 14:32 - 42 ; Luke 22:39 - 46 ; John 18:1 . 164 . In other words , " I became emotional , too . " 165 . This is one of the most important aspects of Yoruba culture in particular , and an African custom in general : when a child is grown and becomes a man or woman , he is obliged to take very good care of his parents in terms of housing , clothing and food . Our elderly ones remain with their children , not in the " home for the elderly " , they always enjoy the company of the'ir children and grandchildren . This is the fruit of 157
96207	96231	96204	96204	Fagunwa	187	' unn^cessaiy extravagance , and enjoins his readers to take care of their parents with the money which they would waste after their parents '
96367	96694	96730	96731	the publisher	3858	’ is the architect of one 's destiny . " The word translated " favour " is tijii which literally means " be ashamed . " However , for communicative purpose , it 's better translated " favour " . or a hat . ed / literally means " man " . Literally , gkin is translated " heart " . In English idiom , however , " soul " better expresses the idea of being in a relaxed state . i.e. , like a shrub by thp bank of the river . This is a pun here : Fagunwa sometimes manipulates the language and makes it serve his humorous purpose in any context . Thus the word gbaphno means being famous or sophisticated , semantically . However , Fagunwa uses the literal meaning here to say something pn a'Super superlative degree , about Olowo - aiye 's good nature and whole- ^meness : a way of giving a very high recommendation of • ® character to ( Mr. ) Death . The literal meaning , therefore , is " he - whom- two - hundred - faces - know . Igba is two hundred . Thus Olowo - aiye is not only known by two hundred faces , but he is also known by six thousand faces ! 183 . The word translated " ignored " here is nani which in reality , has a positive meaning in Yoruba : It really means " care about " , or " make much ofi , but Fagunwa , for one reason or the other , gives it a negative meaning in this context , for he even prays that God should not ndrd ( ignore ? ) us . I believe that tlxis is a textual problem , which needs further exploration . For the time being , we may postulate the fact that it is simply misused w^rile we await a closer linguistic clarification on the 158

" The word translated " load " is eruy that is what it means literaly , but semantically , it has to do with life as a whole , the truth of one 's .existence . 186 . In other words , " I have killed the sophisticated one " who probably thought that he would never die , for he thou^t that life would go on for " ever " . 187 . Literally , " I have made the children of men cry . " 188 . I£a is a god of divinations ; its priests is a diviner or sophist . He is believed to have the power to cast spell on whoever he wants in order to make them suffer in one way or the other . 189 . This statement echoes a Biblical passage found in Psalm 115:5 - 7 . 190 . Fagunwa echoes Matthew 4:7 here . 191 . See Exodus 20:5 . Fagunwa 's narrative is replete with Biblical allusions . 192 . Medicine here means a kind of magical power through which he avenged the wrong done him . 193 . i.e. , he became insane . , 194 . i.e. , a good person . 195 . See Mark 13:7 . It is clear to any close reader of Fagunwa 's narratives , that his thoughts and motives are immersed in religious themes . In fids case , it is the theme of Christ 's second coming as recorded in Mark 13 . 196 . A vain person . 197 . This is a heightened moralisaticn in Fagunwa 's narrative . 198 . i.e. , he was greedy . I choose to translate literally in order to maintain Fagunwa 's parallelism as he balances hands with bossom . 199 . See II Corinthians 6:14 ; I Corinthians 5:9 - 10 . Fagunwa implies that this man failed to listeri to God 's injunction through Christ , hence his eternal damnation . '

Moslems do not eatpork ; it is against their religious teaching . Therefore , to have eaten sari with pork is a serious violation of Islamic religious principles . That is how bad Olowo - aiye 's situation is now , by what Baba - Onirungbon is planning to do to him . 212 . A kola - nut is mainly grown in southern Nigerian , but the Hausas in the North eat it most . 213 . See note No . 15 on ^p .

97833	97856	97448	97448	Le	499	' As it is with most rich ■ people . . 228 . Fagunwa 's narrative is unclear here . He asserts that '
97861	97900	97857	97857	God	186	' for example , and follows- the premise by saying that the intelligent people are uncommon — those who have money and still worship God in their humility . It is difficult to relate that to his premise : '
97904	97906	97907	97907	God	186	' or '
97910	97952	97954	97954	Fagunwa	187	' . 229 . In other words , he decided to multiply women for himself — an act of polygamy which is not against the more or the culture of the Africans — in fact it is a .part of it . 'However

98443	99012	98405	98405	Fagunwa	187	' African cultures , is one of the most serious things that a man and a woman undertake in life . Thus a lot of time is spent in the probing of the family from which a young girl and a young man choose to marry . They are very much concerned about compatibility on all levels of existence before the marriage could be done . Thus divorce is very rare . 249 . This is a Yoruba thought pattern in particular and Grat of the Africans in general concerning the concept of gerontology . The Yoruba people believe that the older a man gets in the world , the deeper and wider is his wisdom and experience ; hence the elderly people are indispensable both within the family and within the society as a whole . Thus the idea of die home for die elderly is not appealing to the Yoruba people ; they want their elderly ones to be with them and enjoy the rest of their days with children and grandchildren , etc . That , to them , is the joy of old age . 250 . Here again is anodier aspect of Yoruba culture which gives a lot of respect ( sometimes to the extent of fear ) to the elderly people , from whom the young ones are supposed to learn things about life . 251 . In other words , " ... he isJooking for trouble . " 252 . That is , the adult through the experiences and wisdom wrought by age , knows the deeper things of life than the young people . 253 . Here again , according to the mores of the Africans in general , and that of the Yoruba people in particular , wisdom , on the part of ) he young people , lies in his recognition of the adult 's place in die world , and his willingness to acknowledge it . 254 . i.e. , people 's ambition in life should be moderate in order to avoid an undue anxiety . 255 . This is a title for diose who are making , or have made pilgrimage to Mecca . 256 . Imam is a Moslerr^priest . 257 . The Moslem spiritual leader is called Anal)?Muhammed . Anabi means a messenger or angel . Thus Muhammed is conceived by the Moslems as God 's Messenger . 258 . In other words , " When the children of men honoured God . " 259 . Fagunwa is apparently Miltonic here : he describes the hurling of Satan out of heaven as found also in Milton 's Paradise Lostl , 36 - 74 ; see also Isaiah 14:12 ; Jude , 1:6 . Fagunwa 's Judeo - Christian theme constitutes a ■ single thread that runs through his narratives . He consistently portrays God 's sovereignty over the heaven as well as the affairs of men in the world . Man 's duty therefore , is to obey him and do his will . This is the only Way out of die grip of Satan who has been hurled out of heaven only to disorganise and deceive God 's creation here in the world . 260 . i.e. , " She was the one who first waved at me . " 261 . That is to say that her cooking is not too tasty . 162

Ten pounds , currency then in use in Fagunwa 's time . 271 . That means'that the people cast speU on his life , and things begin to fall apart . This is an explanation to human sufferings : most of the time , other people 's catastrophy and downs of life are blamed on witches and wizards . . 272 . The pronoun nwon third person plural " they " is not grammatically consistent with tine subject of the sentence . Thus the use of " they " would make it ambiguous . Hence , my choice of " he " for third person singular . 273 . This is an aspect of Fagunwa 's concept of theodicy : he attempts to justify the goodness of God in spite of the existence of evil , which manifests itself in various modes , such as sickness , suffering of all kinds , catastrophies , etc . in the world . See van A. Harrey , A Hand of Theological Terms : Their Meanings and Background ( New York : Macmillan Publishing Co. , 1964 ) , p. 236 . 274 . That is , about their lack of beauty . 275 . Literally , ko mo iwe means " he did not know book . " 276 . i .e . , he did not respect the elders anymore . The African culture dem^ds that the young one , in whatever position he is in life — rich , poor , educated or uneducated — should always respect the elders , or Whoever happens to be older than he is . This is a sign of healthy personality in African culture , and more so , in Yoruba culture in particular . 277 . Or health . 278 . Pound sterling ( currency then in use in Fagunwa 's time ) . 279 . One tin is about 412 litres . 280 . Fagunwa laughs at the ludicrous in human behaviour , in his bid to justify the way of God in the affairs of man . 281 . Literally , " ... if you are getting ready to go forward ... " 282 . This.is directly from Psalm 115:4 - 6 . 283 . A strict English grammatical construction would not allow the verb " seen " in this structure . The right verb would be " heard " as a verb which appropriately describes what the cock does , that is , " say " , in the sentence . 163

102663	102688	102657	102657	i.e.	4029	'' 379 . Fagunwa 's verbal gymnastics is seen in this metaphorical hyperbole ; " laughter weds lau^ter " is his way of saying that ’
102689	103022	103023	103023	he	4038	' we were so happy when we met , we were talking and we were laughing so hard ... " 380 . Literally , " they would be looking at others with little eyes . " 381 . Fagunwa tries to give the reader a hint about the structure of his narrative . It is very complex ; the story is told from the first person point of view , except that it is being reported through the third person . The dominating point of view of the story , however , is the first person . This is what is known as oblique narrative . 382 . Fagunwa gives us his rationale for file story ; he releases his intent for his literary undertaking . This shows that didacticism is not accidental a residue of his naivete in his works , but an accomplishment of a purpose . His basic purpose is to teach — to teach delightfully fiirough the verbal gymnastics and dazzling rhetoric — a vehicle which conveys the reader so smoothly that he forgets the pain of the bumpy road of " sermons " and proverbs that are intended to teach morals . Thus in spite of the modem reader 's resentment , he is lured to read along by Fagunwa 's rhetorical prowess . 383 . Notice Fagunwa 's theological diction here as well as his consistent Biblical language throughout the narrative . Fagunwa 's Judeo - Christian concept and beliefs filter through his works of art . As amatter of fact , the art to him , is simply a means to an end , not an end itself . True art is meant to pleasingly teach , a notion which had been a part of the philosophy of literary art for centuries . See Wilbur Scott/,Fz've Approaches of Literary Criticism ! An Arrangement of Contemporaiy E^ys ( New York : Collier Books , 1962 ) , pp . -41 . 384 . In other words , '
