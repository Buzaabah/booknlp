The jungle law of supply and demand has become so diversified that mini­ markets exist that specialize in the sale of human spare parts . The clientele include supposedly educated men and women , yet so mentally regressed that they believe that a spoonful of powdered human liver or thumb , mixed with their akamu , is certain to make them millionaires between one market day and the next or guarantee their party nomination for governorship or a senate seat . Do Fagunwa 's markets of sinister commodities located in forests of primordial evil appear out of this world ? At least they do not pretend to be churches , mosques or shrines or places of spiritual gathering into which our adventurers can be lured in a false sense of security , in today 's real life , there appears to be no space left that is honoured as a place of universal sanctuary .

But it will not be until tomorrow that I shall narrate the full story of my father . The former adventures that I told to you , tales that you set down for others to read - those were tales of my own life . 1 then spoke briefly of my father 's own adventures .

The following morning , after I had breakfasted on fried bean paste and cold corn pap , and taken my seat in comfort , I sa\NAkara- ogun emerge suddenly before me like a ghommid .

Hunters themselves were terrified of this forest even more than they were of the Forest of a Thousand Daemons , and it was a law in the town that no hunter who had yet to kill an elephant should venture within it . This forest was the very home of marvels there the birds speak in human voices , animals run markets of their own , a variety of trees have no roots , yet their trunks remain cool to the touch and their leaves display a dazzling glaze . The mice are bigger than the rats , snails bigger than the tortoise in the Forest of the Lord of All Deities . The powerful bog - trolls and aggressive ghommids are close friends while bothersome serpents of all kinds terrorize hunters , for in that forest also reigns the Head of ail living reptiles , whose name is Python - of - Rage .

However , progress is out of reach for the hesitant , and I am anything but that as I set out on my way . With the aid of my Creator , it is certain that I shall return to you . The hesitant thinks of his death in the mornirtg and dies in the afternoon , whereas he still had three more days upon earth . One 's mind is the counsellor of one 's existence . So , give me leave to depart , take back my good wishes to your homes , take care of all I leave behind . Man goes forth . Spread the news that the powerful goes where the powerful will- be found , the man of note goes where men of note are found . Let it not be heard from notables , from young and old , that wayfarers to the Forest of the Lord of Heavens never return , let all the gentle people of the world continue to

There are numerous species in those forest depths . Trees as tall as the palm tree , wrapped around by thick parasites , home to huge animals . Birds with sharp - pointed beaks they never strayed too far from the crown of palms lest they miss the kernels that sustain them , just as squirrels did not stay too far from roots . Ribbon - like snakes constantly sought the recesses ; the mamba sought the undergrowth , the python made a home near the streams , while numberless venomous snakes sought the sanctuary of holes . Snails preferred the cool , moist places , the tortoise loved the earth - mounds , the brown hopper skipped between the shrubs while the pigeon sought rarer heights that bird functions like the cockerel of the forest depths , signalling to hunters the time of day , Trees a long time fallen have no more vitality , and mushrooms now grew upon them . The eyes of each animal differed from another , the path of the rodent was straight and smooth while that of the wild boar was broad and

By three o'clock he arrived at a small forest that was neighbour to Igbo Olodumare , this forest being known as Igbo Idakeroro , the Forest of Impenetrable Silence this qualifying as the most soundless place you could find anywhere under the sun . Only one ghommid lived in this forest , and he was more fiery than the very lightning of the sky . The ghommid did not permit anyone to enter Igbo Olodumare , placing in the way of hunters all manner of onerous tasks , yet he was no higher than the measure of two feet , this creature who lived in an outsize ant - hill . A most aggressive being , he moved around with a load of whips every day of his existence . '
10216	10477	10207	10207	his	484	' After my father had wandered aimlessly for a while , he and this tir\y kobold finally set eyes upon each other . A memorable day it was : danger met with trouble , succubus confronted incubus , two lions looked each other in the eye . The name of this creature was Esu - kekere - ode , Tiny Fiend of the Border . He wore neither smock nor trousers , he neither sported a cap nor wore a loincloth , deploying only leaves to cover his genital region . He had only one eye , and that was mounted on his head like a full moon . There was no nose to his face , but his eye extended beyond the border of his mouth and was flat like the palm of the hand . His teeth were similar to a * lion 's , stained red as when the lion has just fed on raw meat . Hair covered him in place of clothing , his entire body was shaggy like a vvhite man 's dog , and a huge lump seemed embedded at the top of his head . Even as he carried his load of whips on his shoulder , so was a huge sack tied round his neck , and that put terror in the beholder , for the sack was thoroughly saturated with blood with the down of birds stuck to it . Medicine gourdlets and dried ato shrubs , snake spines , the feathers of the woodcock and shrub hopper , animal horns large

Just as dense were the metallic rings that turned his fingers black as the fingers of a dye - maker . Ah , take it from me , a most malevolent creature was this ghommid ofthe forest ravine , known as Esu- kekere - ode . '
10721	10792	10711	10713	Esu - kekere	151	' " Who are you ? What are you ? What are you worth ? Of what are you made ? How are you rated ? What do you seek ?

A disagreement took between me and another being at the gates of heaven and it led to my being accused of maligning the King of Heaven . This grew into a conspiracy with others , and they all insisted that 1 be expelled from the , precincts of heaven . I left that place and came to reside beneath the heavens where I have remained a hundred years among the dead who are quartered in the lower regions . 1 learnt all kinds of wisdom from them and from then on , I came
11380	11450	11349	11350	the Creator	3372	' " I am the tiny kobold of the forest fastness , known as Esu - kekere - ode . When I left the dwelling of the dead , I came to thie Forest of Idakeroro where I turned the ant - hill into my home . In this jungle I encountered animals , here I encountered birds , here I met ghommids but all of them I chased out so
11660	11707	11656	11657	a relation	774	' Thus did this ghommid address my father , and my father responded even as it befits one strong man in his dealings with another . He regarded Esu - kekere - ode as a cantankerous woman looks at her husband with daggers in her eyes : '

12387	12453	12381	12383	Esu - kekere	151	' After a while , this vicious ghommid leapt on my father at waist level , and as my father strove to seize him by the leg , he leapt on his shoulder , and when he had squeezed my father at the throat , he gave him a resounding slap . That infuriated my father , and he began to push the kobold forwards until he
12574	12758	12549	12550	this creature	3400	' My father was now becoming weary of the stalemate . He thrust his hand in his pouch , seeking some combat charm . His hands closed on a flute that had come to him through generations . He blew on it and the sound roiled round the entire neighbourhood . He raised the pipe to a tune which proclaimed that since the King of Heaven is the architect of all •victories , the owner of all things on earth and in heaven , being present in the seas and in the air , there is nothing impossiblefor Him . Whatever he wishes will be done , and no one can prevent him from raising anyone to the heights . A pretender can not prevent God from lifting high whomsoever he pleases . My father piped further : the pretender sets out in the morning , black as the soap from plantain leaves of the stream , by noon tie is as brittle as firewood , by evening he has been totally .consumed by fire . The conspirator said to his friends that he '
12811	12880	12798	12798	he	832	' The song echoed throughout the forest , and his flute was more mellifluous than that of the king . What else to expect when the song was a soulful plea it could not help but penetrate the hidden recesses of the mind of this kobold . The creature hung his head like the leaves of the plantain , he stared atthe ground in mental turmoil and spoke : '
13230	13414	13219	13219	I	0	' Thus spoke this kobold , and my father 's rage subsided . He and Esu - kekere exchanged salutations , they shook hands and each turned his face in the direction of their destinations . However , as is only to be expected , a fight does not end without injuries to one , right or wrong . My father had collided with trees , his hunting sack was torn , he lost a most vital charm , and his tobacco pipe was broken . Even so had Esu- kekere sustain injuries . He lost two of his teeth , one of his rings was broken , he broke a leg and now walked like one with ring­ worm on his feet . This is why the wise consider fights like a poison and avoid it constantly , for a brawl is not befitting for humans , it being more like a fish - bone in the throat . But the demented of human society light the torch of the white man and begin to lookfor wars outside their own city boundaries . '
13515	13541	13542	13542	He	484	' , only to have his Maker come to his rescue with a boost of ten pounds that found its . way into his possession . '
13741	13775	13734	13734	he	484	' The wise and the foolish seem indistinguishable when all is well , but the wise become clearly separated in a time of adversity - my father acted the wise at this moment . He
13805	14076	13801	13801	God	129	' " You , King of Heaven who is my maker , you . King of Heaven who created Igbo Olodumare , you the Being of Marvels who created all things of marvel . Creator who made all the hunters of the living world , the time has come when I must pray that you remain my strength in this venture . There are those in this world who , when they departed the world , took their names with them , these are the ones who passed through this world as if a reptile slithered across a rock surface , leaving no footprints . There are those who entered this world and , on leaving , left behind them detestable names , these ones are like dark stains on white clothing . The washerman scrubbed hard to remove the stains until the fabric nearly turned to rags but the stain remained indelible . I pray you , my Creator , let me not be like these . I ask you in all humility that you act on the goodness of your heart , that 1 may be like those who came into this world and shone like the moon that does such good from generation to generation . Their names endured after their passage , and those who came after them labour hard so that they mfght emulate their lives . Even as I proceed , let me return as a man of solidity , so much so that even if the time has come for my departure from this world , the living would ask of one another , '
14091	14155	14163	14163	he	877	' Olowo - aiye prayed no more than this . The King of Heaven heard him from the other side , for just as there is no mortal akin to the angels , there is no rock of reliance like the King of Heaven . My father braced himself and surged forwards , singing , whistling , treading earth like a true warrior . '

However , how these two society ladies found themselves in the forest depths could not fail to astonish anyone . This was what made my father turn round to take another look at them ; and it was at this very moment that the shorter of the two also I } _ _ _ _ _

15585	15693	15694	15694	They	983	' Pay heed , my friend , the surprise of this narrative is that the delightful words from the lips of this woman caused my father to taste love for the first time in his life . Love covered his eyes like the froth on the neck of a wine- gourd . Olowo - aiye , on account of beauty , forgot character , on account of shiny eyes , forgot wisdom , on account of white teeth accepted to espouse a witch , ft was from that day that my father loaded his back with the trouble that he would come to name - woman trouble .

When they had walked around for some time , the woman asked , " Where exactly are you headed ? " My father replied , " Igbo Olodumare . " She then enquired further , " To do what ? " and my father replied , " I 'm

He carries a huge tome'in his hands in which ail the sins of the children of the earth are recorded , meticulously catalogued : the sin of murder , of lying , of boastfulness , the sin of maligning , shamelesnesss , envy , arrogance , greed , and all other kinds of evil conduct . In addition , some sins appear to be minor but are rated serious b'^ Anjonnu - lberu , Guardian of the passage into Igbo Olodumare . Infractions such as a child eating three wraps of corn - meal when he has only been permitted to eat two , being sent on an errand yet playing around on the way , being sent to the river for water and breaking the gourd on the way , putting on new clothes only to have them turned into rags the same day , caught in a lie only to have him follow it up with another , caught out in the second to'hear him seek refuge in another , until it appears that the child wanders around with a pot of lies on his head -all these misdeeds are listed in the book of Anjonnu - iberu , keeper of the gateway into Igbo Olodumare .

There are so many kinds of humanity in the world , such as those who have not sufficient money for a bungalow but begjn to build a multiple storey building , ramming the cap of the thoughtless against their heads . Ajediran , guard well the good character that the Almighty has given you . Your conduct will place you in high esteem , and I thank you .

And I did add that my father 's in - law , the elder sister , accompanied them . '

On sighting my father , he placed the book to one side , inspected his cudgel , caressed his bundle of whips and , satisfied with these accompaniments of contest , he burst into laughter , stood with his hands on his hips , walked a little forward , eyeing Olowo - aiye as he approached in a carefree manner , strutting as befitted a warrior .

No one can enter hear unless he or she swears on this book . I am Anjonnu - lberu , Ghommid of Fear , who serves as Guardian to the Gateway of the Forest of the King of Heaven . I am not simply today 's ebora , I have been here for ages , my sojourn here boasts Just below a count of a thousand years . So , bring yourself over here , come and swear on this register . If you fail to swear , your punishment will be most severe . If you give false testimony , the lion will have you for his meal - restraint on the neck of the insane ! - when I have bludgeoned you on the back on the neck , you will have tasted a dose of what is yet to come .

Take care , think well before you begin to decry your neighbour , because my father was one who would preach to the world that they should cease from sinning , and it was a surprise to him to find that , on this day , when he himself saw that the offences that he exhorted others not to commit , he had himself committed , the sins from which he sought to wean them , he had himself been guilty of , the paths away from which he urged humanity he had often trodden , the discourse from which he had steered his fellow beings , he had himself indulged in , shame encountered shame when my father saw these sins in the book of the Gatekeeper , where the latter had entered them boldly and indelibly .

19563	19710	19524	19524	he	1115	' However , my father refused to confess before the Gatekeeper , because it is the nature of men not to admit to truths before an enemy . Once an individual puts on the attire of misconduct , he resorts to placing a bold face on embarrassing secrets , the language of remorse flees him , everything becomes matter for aggressiveness . My father put down the book , hissed in defiance and announced to Anjonnu - iberu that he had no intention of swearing before anyone . Thunderbolt on anvil ! Iron hook on the lunatic 's back ! Ghommid and human swung into combat ! Violent eruption in the realm of Igbo Olodumare , as dust spiraled upwards to obscure the sky . My father and the Guardian of the Gateway wrestled with each other my good friend , thus began an elemental upheaval I '
19905	20117	19855	19855	his	1138	' It was a tremendous combat , a Chilla of a Thrilla , one that my father never wearied of recounting till his death . According to his account , Anjonnu - iberu nearly broke my father 's back when he smashed him against a tree . But he also wasted no time , because he lifted and crushed Anjonnu - iberu against a buttress , a sharp thorn pierced him in the foot , and light flecks peeled off his skin . The fight lasted ages , for there was no restraint on either combatant , and none of the spectators soyght a quick end to the fight since they considered Anjonnu - kekere an over - assiduous administrator who had lost all credibility among his own peers . Often he had subjected them to chastisement whenever a fight broke out between his wife and himself - if anyone attempted to intervene and counsel peace , he turned a deaf ear , thus he had earned himself an unsavoury reputation . The over assiduous dons the mantle of disgrace , whoever is addressed by a peace - maker in the course of a fight should understand that he is beloved . Anjonnu - iberu absorbed much punishment on that day and he

" '

After a while , Anjonnu- /beru yanked my father 's right leg clean off the ground , raising it towards his shoulder , but my father planted himself with the left as the ghommid began to push him towards a pit , so that he would fall into the hole and be wedged inextricably in it . My father however rescued his right leg and stood firmly with both . The next moment Anjonnu - iberu had bent low . He lifted my father completely from the ground , throwing him forward with all his strength . It was on both legs that my father landed however , rpck solid . He looked at the eborq and laughed , saying , " The back of a cat can not touch the ground - it is taboo ! " Theforest assemblage cheered . '
21431	21711	21418	21418	their	1204	' Eventually , the kobold grew furious , decided to manifest himself as a singular being indeed , and turned himself into a lion . Since my father was no neophyte in the hunter 's trade , he also showed himself as a seasoned hand , he took out the fruit given him by his wife , threw it in his mouth and turned himself into a lion , so lion engaged lion in a fight while the forest roiled from end to end in deafening roars . The spectators took to their heels , running helter - skelter . Some time elapsed and this ghommid turned into a boa - constrictor , Olowo - aiye followed suit , the forest erupted in animal cries . They proceeded in this fashion , changing into animal forms one after the other until they both reverted to that of the boa . The moment that Olowo - Aiye saw his adversary switch to the shape of a boa - constrictor - he seized his chance ! Swift as lightning , he transformed himself into an elephant , whereupon he grabbed the reptile by the head and reduced it to mere pulp . Thus did Olowo - aiye see the end of the Gatekeeper , in an elemental struggle , a Chilla of a Thrilla that would become a reference point throughout the world at that time . Even till tod^y , the elders do not cease to speak of the fight at the gateway to Igbo Olodumare , where both man and spirit turned into pythons and boa constrictors , and even transformed themselves into the elephant , patriarch of all animals .
21717	21908	21418	21418	their	1204	' To cut our Story short , my father returned to human form , but no one ever heard of Anjonnu - iberu any more ; he had perished utterly . My father took the corpse of - the boa , lit a fire and burnt it , rain floods flushed one part into a small stream where the smoke from its head turned into a poisonous fish that exists till today - the day I encounter this species of fish , I shall ensure that I show it to you . The other part that was not flushed into the stream from these ashes turned into a scorpion — again I promise to show you the very specimen when next i encounter it . For its part , the clearing where the fight took place never grew another blade of grass . The forest dwellers built a house on that spot , where the new elected Gatekeeper resided . This new keeper was not like the former ; he loved humans and he loved animals , he loved the mortals of earth and he loved the dwellers of heaven . '

However , it is sad to relate that the new Gatekeeper did not long remain in his position , for even as things transpire among humans , so do they among ghommids . Because this Keeper did not treat his fellow beings as slaves , did not regard them indentured servants , preferred to relate to them as creatures of decency and socialized with them , they turned his sword to a plaything . So indeed we find it among humans , as among the ghommids . There are beings of contumely in the world who will never build upon the advantages that the Lord has given them , they are the ones who exhaust the well of kindness . If you show them respect , treat them as beings of reflection , what you receive in turn is disdain rather than sincere affection ; They can be Jikened to a huge tree that has fallen across the road - it blocks .the passage of vehicles . Once you have interacted with such people , you are disinclined to act kindly to those who follow

Quickly they divested him of his hunting outfit and dressed him in a velvet agbada with trousers also of velvet . They sat a velvet cap on his head like a crown , decorated with gold than dazzled the eye , shod his feet in copper shoes , placed golden rings on his fingers and necklaces of gold around his neck . Next they placed a beaded cane in his hands . His betrothed was also decked in jewels from head to feet , turning her radiant like a rainbow , her teeth gleaming like the noonday sun . Only this woman shared the cup of glory in Igbo Olodumare and — yes , it is I who declare this — my father was a gorgeous specimen of manhood . I say this not because he was my father , it was our own townspeople who turned his appearance into song with the refrain : 0 / owo - o / ye , the elegant one . '

I submitted myself to the hazards of the fight , and placed my trust in my Creator . Kabiyesi , I would like you to know from this day that anyone who desires something good , who resolves on something good , who embarks on something good and places his reliance on the Lord such an individual can never be found at the rear of crowd , never !

Until he left this world , therewasnoday when wedid not burst into laughter when he boasted , as was his habit , " I fed until my stomach was round and taut like the stomach of a small bird , my buttocks ballooned and wobbled like a mound of amala . As for my wife , the door became too narrow for her to negotiate , her buttocks would require the strength of six stalwarts to carry and the thickness of her neck could have been shared.by eight people . Even her walk had changed , she eased up one leg at a time like cattle browsing on a grassy patch . Her comportment was no longer that of an ordinary person , she began to act as a Madame of social standing . Nobility does not like to walk the walk of a commoner , the rich do not like to walk the walk of the poor , and women are lovers of ostentation . Even my sister - in- law had similarly changed her posture . Her countenance was fresh like young leaves on an orange tree and her skin smooth like a three - day old infant . We all ate delicious food , we dug into stew that was out of the world , we ate the arm of livestock , we ate the thigh , we ate the liver , we ate the gizzard , we ate the delicacies of the throat .

When he came into my home the following day , he brought with him the manuscript that his father had written with his own hands and showed it to me . On those pages , his father had narrated his own story from the time of his stay with the King of the Forest of Olodumare till that moment when he finally returned home . Having displayed the script and spread himself comfortably in a chair , my visitor stressed that I should regard him as if he was himself Olowo - aiye , now assuming his father 's voice .

Today happens to be the convention day of the beasts of the forests , where all types in the animal world gather to debate the condition of their existence . It was hunger that chased me out of the gathering , for once huhger is eliminated from labour , it spells the end of hardship . However , pay attention to the words I am about to say to you : hundreds of people have behaved exactly the way < you have , and just as many have perished on the tree - top . When the great convention is over , you will hear the sound of a gong . After that gong , you will experience a powerful wind , this wind will be even more powerful than the earlier one . That is the moment to seek your escape . This wind is however extremely powerful , so that the trees that sway to the ground also swing back into position . Please , take good care that the swaying trunks do not hit you on the head , that the branches do not smash the back of your head lest your skull be cracked , and all your brain matter spattered , and yourself turned into a wayfarer to heaven . What I have to say does not exceed this .

We walked a little distance in this forest , and arrived at an enclosure that was strikingly well kept . When my guide opened the door to this compound and we entered , I saw a wide road that opened up magnificently towards an edifice in the distance . We followed this road until we arrived at the house , and when I looked around , I saw that house itself stood on a rock and that its walls were made entirely of stone . The man opened the door , I entered , and he followed . Arrived in the interior , I was fearful of placing my feet on the floor since it looked so exquisite , dazzling the eye , but I followed the man . The house was , I now realized , a storey building , and when we had walked some eighteen feet , I saw a ladder that was used to gain entrance into the upper floor .

When we have paid our courtesy visit to Death , we shall visit his wife - for she keeps a separate home , a Spirit whose name is Disease , a most depressing personality .

She is a most arrogant show - off and , thanks to her presence , the dwellers of heaven began to turn their backs on one another . In the end , war broke out among them , her followers embarked on a conflict so intense that the matter reached the hearing of the King of Heaven . When Disease began to tell her side of the story to her own Maker , such inappropriate language issued from her mouth that Edumare expelled her from the borders . After this , she divorced her husband . For forty - four years . Disease was espoused to Satan who is the King of the Realm of Perdition , but after only five months , on the eleventh day of the forty - fourth year , she fled the Realm of Perdition as she found the smoke from its flames much thicker than her own . It was then that Death asked permission of Edumare to we d the woman , as a most qualified helpmeet for his own occupation . '

However , when I consider this from a different point of view , it seems to me that if the world did not harbour such people , it would not be as delightful as it is .

Take a Yoruba man who has no ties to a royal house , along whose lineage no one had ever worn a crown , none among his forebears has ever narrated a family history that relates to the ancestor Oduduwa , yet such an individual leaves his own town for the adjoining , arrives there and begins to aspire to the throne - such a man is no different from a baboon , except that his skin

This servant was one of heaven 's own indigenes , and the world knew him as Asoju - Olodumare . The season of his visitation was an eventful one on earth , songs collided with songs , drums contested with drums , dances faced off against dance , all engaged in festivities in honour of their Creator . At the time I speak of , Satan had not yet taken root within earth 's expanse , he lived as an important personage in the precincts of heaven . However , when Satan carried his sacrifice beyond the limits of the crossroads , became deaf to the words of God , the dwellers of Heaven chased hini out . It was then that Satan found a way to ruin the works of men , and they began to turn their backs on God . Satan was far more wicked than the rest of heaven 's denizens , and when he occupied the hearts of men , they proceeded to enter sinfulness as one enters one 's bedroom , they cast the hiss of disdain in the face of their Creator , complained that the positions he had assigned to them were inadequate and addressed Him in a manner most unbecoming .

51354	51484	51487	51492	the men who came before Asoju	2271	' God loved humanity . He treated mortals as children . So when Asoju returned to heaven and reported that earth dwellers were in a state of discontent , he sent him back to ask of everyone what they truly desired , so that he could fulfill their wishes . When Asoju returned to earth , he sounded the town- crier 's gong all over the world inviting all peoples to meet with him , and make their requests , so that he could report back to his Boss . For three solid years he was detained on earth , taking down messages for heaven . All kinds of requests were made , far more than one can enumerate , but i shali mention just a handful of them . '

It was not even she who was the first object of my attention , at first I had no intention of marrying her . When the useless woman first entered the marital home , she had no sense of fashion , she was out of tune with the times , her clothes were ill - fitting , her gait unattractive , her cooking hostile to the passage of the throat . She could not utter one word in conversation - the home was constantly wrapped in unearthly silence . She was sickly , every day it was a visit to one healer after another . On top of it all , her family from one generation to the next has remained impoverished - they own nothing . Now , my friend who lives next door never owned a halfpenny , it waS his father - in - law who turned him into a man to be noticed , who stood guarantor for him for a loan from the white man .

All the valuables that I had when I began this job are all damaged , they were damaged from constant moving as I loaded and unloaded bundles of my possessions . Twelve of my wife 's cooking pots have been smashed , a hundred and fifty pieces of cutlery lost , the children have no more sleeping mats , countless are the small items we have lost - no one knows in what direction they went - and just as we are settling down to enjoying the company of new - found friends , that is when we are again forcibly separated .

He petitioned ; " Servant of earth 's Creator , servant of heaven 's Creator , my request is difficult , nevertheless , I pray you to grant it . Tell the King of Heaven that the town into which he permitted me to be born does not satisfy me . I want the children of earth to know me as an indigene of a different town , I no longer wish to be known as being connected in any way with my town . Since the day of my birth , I have known no pleasure . Seven children I have had , two among them have died , and 1 have no doubt in my mind that they were killed and eaten by witches . My occupation is farming , I have gained no benefit from it as the soil is unproductive . Yams do not burgeon , plantains do not mature , the melon does not bear seeds I do not harvest more than two basketfuls of the melon seed in any one year . '
53105	53166	53170	53170	some	367	' Thus and thus were the petitions from far and wide , the people continued to make more requests . Asoju - Olodumare had stipulated that no one should make any request that involved their illnesses unless they were prepared to substitute a different illness for their present ailment , having first considered the comparative ravages done by the diseases .

Before their = dispersal however , he served.them notice that he would return in fourteen years to see how they had been prospering under the new changes that they had requested .

They wanted to return to what they were before . At the end of three years , wailings and lamentations were in full echo around the world . By the end of six years , the people began to perform rituals and sacrifices to the King of Heaven to send back Asoju - Olodumare earlier than the stipulated time . They attempted to sway God from his schedule but of course this proved impossible . They sacrificed goats , sheep , they slaughtered cows at the crossroads , they killed cockerels , breeding hens , they even indulged in human sacrifice but none of this made the slightest dent in Edumare 's resolve . There would be no visitation until the fourteen years had passed . '

The one who protested that his wife was a daughter of paupers had married the daughter of a rich man .

When Boa - of - Fury slithered out in the morning for his bath and felt a cut from the first machete , he would instinctively race faster , while the blades would continue to slice his underbeliy in ribbons , spilling out his guts .

Some testified that when we^arrived at the place of the Seven Women , the man looked in their direction and turned off towards them , others claimed that he had separated before we arrived there , and that he must have got lost In the forest . However , everyone merely said what he wished and one^did not know what to believe ; what we do know for certain is that we departed the palace of Boa - of - Fury with Ibanuje - isal^ , and left the valley ofthe Accursed Women without him . We had left this valley when we met a ghommid on an errand from the Furry - Bearded - One , he had only one eye . We exchange(;l very warm greetings at the reunion for , by this time , we felt no fear of ghommids . We constantly ran into one another , parted from , one another , chatted with one another , clowned with one another , cooked bean pottage for one another , indeed , it only lacked little for us ourselves to be accounted ghommids . The one - eyed ghommid gave me a letter written to me by the Furry - Bearded - One , and the contents ofthe letter were as follows : Residence ofthe Furry - Bearded - One Who lives on the Rock Promontor Care ofthe one - eyed Ghommid Half - way Outpost of Heaven and earth Eighth Day ofthe Sixth Month A thousand and forty - fourth Year

Five , be patient with people of the world,.for if you fail in this , you will become an idiot like they . Sixth , never expect in all your life that if you extend goodness to the children of the world,.you will receive their thanks . Only few of humanity recognizes kindness . He who extends his generosity gladdens the heart of Oiodumare , this is why others have not abandoned doing good from anger , and in any case , no one can ever predict from where his reward will come , the person whom you thought would appreciate benevolence would not , while those from whom it was least expected would , and spread the news of your deed all oVer the world . Seven , do not concern yourself only with what concerns you , you are not alone in the world , always lend a hand to the next person . My dear Olowo - aiye , I thank you for the little time that we spent together , and I thank you'for the money you gave to my household at your departure . I leave you under the protection of the King of Heaven May Edumare be your pillar of support . My entire household sends you greetings . Your very good friend . The Furry - Bearded - One .

Only the King of Heaven can repay the care you lavished on me . What did my lips not savour in your house ? Pounded yam or oka , or is it maize ? A dog does not forget its benefactor , I can never forget you , you are indeed a man among men . Ah , Furry- Bearded - One , I thank you . Even as the Moslem remembers . Allah , as the Christian remembers God , even so will I rememberyou forever . I thankyoualsoforthevarious counsel you offered me , I have not forgotten , notm the least , it is all folded within my left palm whith is tjie hand with which I do not eat . I want you to know that these counsel are priceless , some are like silver , others like gold , yet others like diamonds which are stones of immense vaiue . if one had to pay money for advice , some would cost at least a thousand pounds . Therefore whoever offers one important advice bestows on one an invaluable gift . May Heaven not piace us in the company of enemies , for the counsel of enemies is like a seventeen - day old stew,'while the guidance of friends is sweeter than honey itself , this is why . the \^l - bred should reflect deeply before he follows the counsel of others or kicks it of in rejection . You are a friend , Furry- Bearded - One , and your counsel has entered into the recesses of my head . I also have some advice to offer you , for what concerns you concerns me . 1 observed while 1 was with you that your

I can not narrate all the things that befell me before I returned to the spot where ! first missed my way in the Forest of Olodumare on.setting out from my home - that is;.where I left my wife before finding myself perched precariously on a treetop for quite some time . If I embarked on that part of the story to tell what .my eyes endured , this would require , yet another book on its own . But what . I shall.reveal is that it took six months after the receipt of the letter from Furry - Beard before I regained the residence of the King of Igbo Olodumare . We encountered numerous small towns , and the rewards I gained were indeed plentiful '

But for the wife who was awaiting me , he would not have let me go , for he still offered that fremain and live with him . The king was extremely hospitable , caused me no suffering of any kind , he took care of me to the limit . He was not like one of those who , when God has finally placed them in a high position , look down on others with the eye of belittlement , thinking that it is for them alone that the world was made .

It took two days for me to transcribe this part , I wrote until my shoulder ached to crack , Akara - ogun the son of Olowo - aiye being the one who read out the transcript for me . When we were done , he said to me : '
